Small network continues to provide good results. Generally the best approach seems to be to select a 'data quality' cutoff related to the error of the early GMRES iterations, and only add data that are above the cutoff. Furthermore, it is key to train frequently when this data is added. After an initial training period, it seems that only a few training iterations are needed later on. This ensures that we do not over fit and not waste training computations.  By normalizing NN inputs, the performance of the small NN continues to be great as expected. NOTE: normalzing the RHS as input to the NN is essential.
