2020-05-06 16:22:03 [INFO] <ipython-input-16-7631bb7b79e9> 1 - It seems changing architectures does little to mitigate overfitting.
 The most computationally cheap options seems to be reducing the NN size and thresholding what data is added to the training set.
  These different architecture results were thrown away since they essentially gave the same output. 
  Adding a threshold seems "good enough" for this small example.
